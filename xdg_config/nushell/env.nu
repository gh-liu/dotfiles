# env.nu
#
# Previously, environment variables were typically configured in `env.nu`.
# In general, most configuration can and should be performed in `config.nu`
# or one of the autoload directories.
#
# This file is generated for backwards compatibility for now.
# It is loaded before config.nu and login.nu
#
# Also see `help config env` for more options.
